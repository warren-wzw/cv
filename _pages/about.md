Hello, welcome to my homepage!

My name is Zhiwei Wang, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Zhejiang University of Technology. My research primarily focuses on image processing and deep learning, particularly in the areas of multimodal data fusion (RGB images and visible light images), semantic segmentation, and more. I am dedicated to enhancing the performance of computer vision systems and their adaptability across various application scenarios through advanced deep learning methods and multimodal technologies.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong background in engineering practice. I have interned at Silan  and Sightcare, where I gained expertise in hardware, driver development, and algorithm deployment acceleration. This experience has allowed me to accumulate extensive practical knowledge and the ability to translate theoretical research into real-world applications. Throughout my graduate studies, I have consistently combined academic exploration with industrial practice, striving to advance the research and application of intelligent vision systems. 

In my daily work and studies, I frequently take notes and post them into  [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/warren103098?type=blog), demonstrating strong writing and coding habits.
